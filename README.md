restore-db-and-files
====================

This role picks up from the stancel.restore-bareos-backup role where files are restored to a computer or server that were backed up from some server or computer onto a Bareos or Bacula backup system. The role restores a Gzipped MySQL dump file into a MySQL/Percona/MariaDB DBMS and copies one or more file paths into the correct/final location paths needed to fully restore a working backup to the server you are running this role against. An example of a file path to copy over might be the web application files being copied over into the webserver's document root, but could be any path.


Requirements
------------

Need to already have MySQL / MariaDB / Percona Server and your webserver (Apache or Nginx) already setup and configured. The defaults assume a Debian based Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.) with a default webserver document root of `/var/www/html`. You can override those default variables if that is not the case.

Role Variables
--------------

The Document Root or file path where the files will be stored and served up by your webserver. The default path is `/var/www/html` and assumes you are running Apache2 on Debian or Ubuntu.

First part =>Â *restore_db_and_files_web_files_path:* is the root directory of your webserver

Second part =>  *restore_db_and_files_web_directory_for_application:* is the application directory inside the root directory

!Be aware of the starting / !

```
    restore_db_and_files_web_files_path: "/var/www"
    restore_db_and_files_web_directory_for_application: "/html"

		}
```
