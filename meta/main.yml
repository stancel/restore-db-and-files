  description: This role picks up from the stancel.restore-bareos-backup role where files are restored to a computer or server that were backed up from some server or computer onto a Bareos or Bacula backup system. The role restores a Gzipped MySQL dump file into a MySQL/Percona/MariaDB DBMS and copies one or more file paths into the correct/final location paths needed to fully restore a working backup to the server you are running this role against. An example of a file path to copy over might be the web application files being copied over into the webserver's document root, but could be any path.
